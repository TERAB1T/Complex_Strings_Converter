# Complex_Strings_Converter for ESO

This program is suitable for conversion of the whole file (with Lua constructs and other stuff). Don't use it on files with French and German strings! Or they'll be broken.

## Usage

Paste content of the whole file (ru.lua or something similar), press the button, paste converted text back to the file, enjoy the results.

## Example

For this example we will use addon AUI - Advanced UI. Download the addon, open the file \AUI\L10n\ru.lua. Copy its content and paste it to the program. Press the button and copy converted text back to the file.
